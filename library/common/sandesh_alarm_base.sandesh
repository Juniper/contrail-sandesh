/**
 * An AlarmTemplate consists of a comparison operator,
 * and two operands to be compared
 * 
 * operand1 contains a list of keys used to examine the UVE's JSON tree
 * As we process these keys against the UVE's JSON tree:
 *     - If we are at the last key, use the value of the current subtree.
 *       Processing is finished.
 *     - Otherwise
 *       - If the current subtree is a JSON object, go deeper into the subtree 
 *         according to this key. Process the next key in the list
 *       - If the current subtree is a JSON array, process each element of the 
 *         array with the current key
 *       - Any other situation is unexpected; this UVE tree cannot be processed
 *         with this operand specification
 * Also, we will use the "vars" attributes to print parts of the UVE other than
 * the operand1 and operand2 value inthe Alarm description
 *     
 * operand2 is what we want to compare the first operand to
 * It can be either:
 *     - a list of keys to find which part of the UVE
 *       to compare operand1 to. There is no "vars" element.
 *       "vars" can be specified with operand1 only.
 *     - JSON string representing a fixed value
 *       (The special value "null" is used to check for whether operand1 exists,
 *        using the operators "!=" and "=="
